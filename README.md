# WallDesigner
 A wall designer(painter) for console games(Windows only)
this program uses WinApi so Windows platform is a must.
this is a beta version. There will be some errors at compile time, ignore them for now.
for best experience, keep matrix size below 200 and pixel size above 4.
design is saved as coordinates. not as a JPEG file.
